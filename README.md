# BreastCancerDetection
Our project focuses on using machine learning classification algorithms to develop a breast cancer detection system. We gathered a diverse dataset and applied preprocessing techniques, feature selection, and various classification algorithms to train and evaluate our models. Our dataset is available through the sklearn.datasets in Python.

# BreastCancerDetection
Our project focuses on using machine learning classification algorithms to develop a breast cancer detection system. We gathered a diverse dataset and applied preprocessing techniques, feature selection, and various classification algorithms to train and evaluate our models. Our dataset is available through the sklearn.datasets in Python.
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
breast_cancer = load_breast_cancer()
